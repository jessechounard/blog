Well, this was surprisingly easy to setup and get running. It took me maybe five minutes to create a domain, deploy the blog with Deno Deploy, and then point the domain at it. It even has automatic deployment available, so as soon as I commit this to the main branch on github, it should go right out. I'm going to try pushing this up with a branch and pull request. If you can read this, I guess it worked.

This is all very slick. I'm very impressed with [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), and need to come up with some simple app ideas to experiment with it some more. Maybe using [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)? It looks pretty cool too.
